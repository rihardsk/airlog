# Airlog
This code is for an air quality measurement device that I'm building. It's based
on the [Knurling Sessions book](https://session20q4.ferrous-systems.com/) but
I'm deviating slightly and will deviate even more as things progress.

Currently the device consists of:
- a nrf52840 DK but I'll change that to some other nrf52840 based board later
- SCD30 CO2 sensor
- SGP40 VOC sensor
- an LCD module
- some neopixels

But I'm planning to also add:
- a BMP388 digital pressure sensor
- SPS30 particulate matter (PM) sensor
